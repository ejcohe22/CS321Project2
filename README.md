This project is an infix to assembly generator designed in Java. This project features a "homemade" generic stack, an infix to postfix generator, and a postfix to assembly generator.

## Extensions:

  For our extensions we created a class diagram before coding. This was super helpful in organizing what files we are creating and helped us understand the project before blindly coding. We also used GitHub's automated Kanban board to organize the project. This was useful in dividing the work and also gave a visual indicator of the projects progression. We organized the increments into issues with checkboxed goals.
